- Member of the Viral Media Lab, led by [Andrew Lippman](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/lip/overview/).
- Explored how the style (e.g. delivery, tone, color palette) with which media presents information affects our perception and understanding of the content
- Developed a distributed streaming system, [SuperGlue](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/superglue/overview/), which listened to ~20 live video feeds, applied a series of modules (e.g. generative network style transfer, speech-to-text, etc), and generated structured output for ML training / evaluation purposes.
