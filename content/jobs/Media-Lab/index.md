- Part of the Viral Media Lab, where I focused on understanding how we perceive media, whether it be news, video-calls, or voice.
- Helped improve a news processing pipeline which performed NLU, emotion analysis, and face-detection to understand how the way news are structured affect the viewer.
- Currently, in the process of finding ways to improve our video conferencing experience.
