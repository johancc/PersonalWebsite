- Worked alongside the Google Search team on improving their [intent-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_intent) understanding of websites. My focus was to find a hierarchical relationship between intents.
- Constructed a feature extraction pipeline which extracts hierarchical information about intents.
- Engineered a distributed Flume job which processed petabytes worth of websites.
